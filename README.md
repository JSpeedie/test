# cmp-tree

### Project Description

This repo contains multiple different implementations of the same program:
`cmp-tree`. The program functions as a sort of combination between `cmp` and
`tree`, allowing you to compare the full contents of two directories and find
any disparities.

### Motivation

The impetus for this project came from my need to compare one backup of mine
that had suffered from a filesystem error which I attempted to recover from to
another backup that had not suffered the error. I wanted to make sure that
every single file contained on the recovered backup was byte-for-byte identical
with the corresponding file on the healthy backup.
